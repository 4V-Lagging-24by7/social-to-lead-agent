ServiceHive AI CRM is a cloud-based SaaS platform designed to help startups and small to mid-sized businesses capture, manage, and qualify customer leads automatically.

The platform uses an AI-powered conversational assistant to engage website visitors in real time, answer product-related questions, and identify users with high purchase intent.

Key Features:

1. AI-Powered Conversational Chat
ServiceHive provides an intelligent website chat assistant that can answer frequently asked questions about the product, pricing, and features. The chat assistant is designed to guide users through the product offering and encourage meaningful interactions.

2. Automatic Lead Detection and Qualification
The system analyzes user messages to detect buying intent such as demo requests, pricing inquiries, or contact requests. When high intent is detected, ServiceHive automatically initiates a lead capture flow.
